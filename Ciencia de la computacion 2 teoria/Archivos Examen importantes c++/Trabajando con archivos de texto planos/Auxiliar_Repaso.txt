With polymorphism, you can design and implement systems that are easily extensibleâ€”

new classes can be added with little or no modification to the general portions of the pro-
gram, as long as the new classes are part of the inheritance hierarchy that the program pro-
cesses generally. The only parts of a program that must be altered to accommodate new

classes are those that require direct knowledge of the new classes that you add to the hier-
archy. For example, if we create class Tortoise that inherits from class Animal (which

might respond to a move message by crawling one inch), we need to write only the Tor-
toise class and the part of the simulation that instantiates a Tortoise object. The portions

of the simulation that process each Animal generally can remain the same
